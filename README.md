# My Trails Images Portfolio Website - My Travel Stories from Japan ðŸ—¾

Welcome to my simple React portfolio website that displays a collection of my travel images from Japan. This project is intended to serve as a platform for my learning and experimentation with React development and related technologies. The website consists of four main pages: Home, Gallery, Blog, and Contact. While the Gallery and Home pages are fully functional, please note that the Blog page is still under development.

## Technologies Used

- React: The website is built using the React library, allowing for efficient component-based development and a smooth user experience.
- React Router DOM: Page navigation and routing are handled using React Router DOM, ensuring a seamless transition between different sections of the website.
- Redux: Redux is utilized to manage the authentication state, providing a consistent and reliable user experience across pages.
- Django Rest Framework (DRF) Backend: The website interacts with a DRF backend to retrieve image information and URLs, filter images, and upload new images.
